# Running the bot

Create a file named `discordtoken.txt` containing your API token. (<https://discordapp.com/developers/applications>)

1. Run `recompile.bat` once, to set everything up
2. Run `RUN THE BOT.bat` whenever you want the bot to launch

If you aren't using Windows and can't run batch files, then just open a shell in the directory and run these commands:

1. `curl -L https://github.com/luvit/lit/raw/master/get-lit.sh | sh`
2. `./lit install SinisterRectus/discordia`

Then, to run the bot, just do `./luvit bot.lua`.
